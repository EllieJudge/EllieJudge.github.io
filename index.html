				<p><strong>An obsession</strong> with shoes?</p>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/shoe.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Being low-key addicted to shopping I ended up with way too many clothes, so started selling them on
					Depop. Although I only fully invested in this for a short period, I managed to crack the Depop
					algorithm and got featured a few times getting over 7000 followers which was pretty unexpected and
					kinda cool. The secret (I think) is to post something new every day... but you didn't hear that from
					me. üòâ</p>

				<p>Despite plans of becoming a Depop superstar I soon realised this was unrealistic as I was nearing 30,
					had a beer belly out of control and on top of that it is basically impossible to find flats to rent
					in Manchester with rooms big enough for photography equipment for less than ¬£400 pcm.</p>
				<p><strong>The 27 Club</strong> was when I discovered coding. This took my lifes trajectory on an
					unexpected, but brilliant course.</p>

				<h2>The road to hell is paved with good intentions</h2>

			<div class="content">
				<p><strong>I studied </strong>Media and Performance at Salford University. The course was crap so I
					switched to English Literature. I loved this, and did pretty well... unfortunately getting a bit too
					big for my boots I applied to transfer to the University of Manchester. They accepted me! Which
					turned out to be a crying shame because once I got there I hated it and become increasingly lonely
					and isolated. Eventually dropping out from anxiety and depression. Up until that point though, I
					adored reading books and writing about wanky 17th century poets (nngghhhhhh Shakespeare I love
					you...) </p>

						<h3>Nervosa</h3>
						<p>Having struggled with eating disorders since the age of twelve I found a strange and
							unexpected comfort in photography and self portraits. This was the opposite of what I
							expected, as I have always hated photos of myself. Playing with colour and composition
							releases a creativity I rarely get to exercise. The photos themselves challenge the false
							images I have inside my head. </p>

				<h3>Django Girls, to Code Nation to Tech Returners</h3>
				<p>When I was just starting out on my tech adventure I went along to a meet-up called Django Girls.
					At this point I barely knew how to turn on my laptop let alone what Django was, but it sounded cool.
					It was there I made my first techy friend, met some lovely people... and somehow managed to win a
					Scholarship to
					study on the Master course at Code Nation!? The day I found out I'd won the compeition and would get
					to do
					their coding course for free was one of the best days of my life. I was screaming when I found out
					and
					had a skip in my steps for weeks after. Until that point I had felt stuck. Working in minimum wage
					jobs
					with little or no progression or exciting possibilities for the future. The Tech Dream had up until
					this
					point consisted of me, sitting alone at night in bars and pubs, working my way through free code
					camp with no
					one to ask or speak to when I got stuck. When I got to Code Nation though it was a shock to the
					system. I'd
					enjoyed coding by myself, quietly, with no pressure. Suddenly I was surrounded by people who had
					taken
					getting onto the course a lot more seriously than I had (I'd won it by accident really - never
					thinking
					I'd actually be accepted). And as everyone whizzed through the topics I fell behind and felt
					overwhelmed.
					All of my past insecurities and feelings of inadequacy crept up. Most days I cycled home crying.
					Fast forward nearly two years and even though I'm still not a Ninja coder (yet!)
					I have: gotten a job with a company that I love. Built a website. Won a Made in Manchester award
					(which
					is hilarious and in no way deserved or indicative of my actual tech ability, but still really nice).

				<h3>What I like about tech</h3>
				<p>There are lots of things I like about tech. I like coding. I've loved making this little page.
					But what thrills me the most is how someone like me, who was working in bars and restaurants and
					little (lovely)
					clothes shops, selling charity shop garms online - can suddenly get catapulted into a different
					life in less than a year. Towering buildings
					overlooking vast cities. Insights into some of the most influential companies in the world. This is
					insane.
					I can't believe it.
					Being someone with a keen interest in politics and making things "better", the ability to quizz
					people that create some of the
					most far-reaching apps and often - unfortunately - some pretty far-reaching problems, is thrilling.

					It feels like the potential of tech knows no bounds. And with this new found insight into this once,
					out of reach world,
					comes a great responsibility. Not only to, when the opportunity arises, challenge the way tech
					companies operate, but also, if I
					get the chance, to create something exciting, fresh and new.

						<p>‚ÄúSocial media is biased, not to the Left or the Right, but downward. The relative ease of
							using negative emotions for the purposes of addiction and manipulation makes it relatively
							easier to achieve undignified results. An unfortunate combination of biology and math favors
							degradation of the human world. Information warfare units sway elections, hate groups
							recruit, and nihilists get amazing bang for the buck when they try to bring society down.
							The unplanned nature of the transformation from advertising to direct behavior modification
							caused an explosive amplification of negativity in human affairs.‚Äù
